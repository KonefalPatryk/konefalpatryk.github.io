        <h3>Motion Capture Test (Personal Pandemic Project 2020)</h3>
        <p>I wanted to learn how games work and played around with game files with various programs and learned how to connect a Kinect v1 & Kinect v2 to the computer and how to use it for motion capture and photogrammetry, and then used a character model from the game BattleForge (2009) now called Skylords Reborn, to then use it to learn about rigging and weight painting and combining it all together for a short video.</p>
        <h4>The recording demonstrates the use of a single Kinect v2 sensor, resulting in noticeable jitter in the animation due to its limitation of tracking from only one direction.</h4>
        <p>Upon reflection I have learnt how to better optimize an animation through changing the recording environment and making sure it's set under the a
          ppropriate conditions for the best tracking motion tracking quality. ​Key things I've Learnt:
            Rigging
            Weight Painting
            Motion Capture
            Photogrammetry
        ​</p>
